Added option -p (and --shit)

Option -p initalizes the MD5 algorithm with some arbitrary string.
This is to modify the md5 algorithm, to change calculated values.
For example 'md5chk -p a -d b c' gives the same as 'md5chk -d ab ac',
but the prefix is not shown in the output.

The new integration option --shit is prepared, but not yet operational.
(Sorry for the name, but I needed a silly option name which will not
interfere with another option which already is in use.)
Before you ask: SHIT will provide a built in co-processing method like
shell pipes.  However it will skip many fork() calls which are very slow
platforms like CygWin.  It also will work over network sockets.
