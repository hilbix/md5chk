Options -c, -l and -m added, install path now /usr/local/bin/

If you have a very big fiile the MD5 sum can be broken up into parts,
say each 10K one MD5 sum is taken.  If set to 0 means all the full file.

Output is then like FIRST+SECOND+LAST=COMPLETE

With option -l the -m is overlapping, that is each output MD5 covers two blocks instead of one.

Output then is like FIRST-FIRSTSECOND-SECONDLAST+LAST=COMPLETE

Also new is option -c, with this you can do an MD5 of data which goes throgh a pipe.
