Minor changes

The new integration option --shit is prepared, but not yet operational.
(Sorry for the name, but I needed a silly option name which will not
interfere with another option which already is in use.)

Before you ask: SHIT will provide a built in co-processing method like
shell pipes.  However it will skip many fork() calls which are very slow
platforms like CygWin.  It also will work over network sockets.
